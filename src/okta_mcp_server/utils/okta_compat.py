"""Compatibility shims that make the Okta SDK tolerant of real-world API responses.

The Okta SDK ships auto-generated Pydantic models (``SamlApplication``,
``BrowserPluginApplication``, ...) that mark fields as *required* and constrain
some fields to fixed enums. Live orgs legitimately return apps that omit those
fields or use other values, for example:

* SAML apps missing ``settings.signOn.assertionSigned`` / ``responseSigned`` /
  ``honorForceAuthn`` / ``requestCompressed`` / ``allowMultipleAcsEndpoints``.
* Browser-plugin apps whose ``name`` is not one of the SDK's hard-coded template
  names (e.g. ``hellosign_hellofax``).

``okta.api_client.ApiClient`` deserializes ``List[Application]`` atomically -- a
single non-conforming app raises ``pydantic.ValidationError`` and aborts the
*entire* ``list_applications`` / ``list_assigned_applications_for_group`` call.
That takes down the whole app list (and any group-app audit that walks it),
rather than the one offending app.

This module patches the single deserialization choke point so a model that fails
strict validation is reconstructed leniently (validation bypassed via
``model_construct``) instead of taking down the response. The MCP server only
ever *reads* and summarizes apps, so lenient parsing on read is safe and the
returned object keeps the same concrete type and field shape as a healthy one.

The patch is idempotent and defensive: if the SDK internals change and the
expected hook point is absent, it logs a warning and leaves the SDK untouched.
